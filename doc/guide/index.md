# Introduction

VO-DML is defined formally in an [IVOA Standard](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/VODML/index.html), 
this guide is intended to offer practical assistance to those who want to 
use VO-DML to create data models, and then create code that can serialize those 
models to various formats. 

The purpose of writing data models is two-fold

* It defines concepts for a particular domain in an abstract way that provides a common discourse about meanings within that domain.
* It provides a machine-readable representation that can be transformed in various ways that allow 
  instances of the model to be transported, stored and queried.
