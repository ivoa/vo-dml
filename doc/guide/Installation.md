Installation
============

The VO-DML tooling is based around [gradle](https://gradle.org) which itself
is based on Java. It is recommended that a minimum of JDK 11 is installed 
(to be compatible with other tools) using a package manager for your OS and 
similarly use a package manager for gradle installation.

The functionality of the tooling is then encapsulated with a gradle plugin which
is configured [in the quickstart instructions](QuickStart.md)

Note the documentation tasks of the tools that produce the overall model diagram also require that [graphviz](https://graphviz.org)  be installed.
