Documentation
=============

```shell
gradle vodmlDoc 
```

will generate standard documentation into the directory `build/generated/docs/vodml/` (this can be changed with the `outputDocDir` setting)

This will produce a model diagram, latex and html formatted documentation, as well as a graphml representation of the model
that can be hand edited with [yEd](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed) for nicer looking model diagrams.
